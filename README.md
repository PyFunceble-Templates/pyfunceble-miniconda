# @PyFunceble on miniconda
This script consist of two parts.
1. setup_miniconda.sh
1. miniconda_pyfunceble.sh

If everything works as expected you should never run setup_miniconda more than once.
I f you by any means needs to rerun this script, please first to ensure the destination
folder are deleted, this script do not check this.
